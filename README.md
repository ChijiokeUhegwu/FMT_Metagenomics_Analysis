# FMT_Metagenomics_Analysis
This project presents a complete metagenomic workflow analyzing fecal samples from Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) donors and recipients (responders and non-responders). Starting from raw sequencing reads, the pipeline includes quality control, assembly, gene prediction (via Prodigal), and functional annotation using eggNOG-mapper. Comparative analyses were then performed to identify enriched or depleted microbial functions related to key metabolic pathways such as short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, bile acid metabolism, carbohydrate utilization, and lipid biosynthesis, offering insights into microbial functional shifts associated with FMT outcomes in overweight and obese individuals.
